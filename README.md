Approval Framework
To develop an effective approval framework application based on your specifications, we need to focus
on creating a robust and flexible system. This system will handle various workflows and approval
processes involving multiple users: Aarav, Priya, Rajesh, Sunita, and Mohan. Here's a structured
approach to building the application:
### Core Features:
1. **Multiple Workflows Based on Approval Criteria**:
- Workflow 1: Triggered when the cumulative value of the approval exceeds 100.
- Workflow 2: Activated for approvals over 1000 in cumulative value.
- Workflow 3: Initiated for approvals exceeding 10000 in value.
- Approval Type Workflow: A separate flow for approvals for different approval types. regardless of
their value. Ex:'urgent', 'small', 'adhoc';
2. **Multi-Level Workflow Progression**:
- Sequential Approval: Once Aarav approves a request, it moves to Priya, then to Rajesh, and
continues until the last configured user.
- This sequential flow ensures orderly processing and tracking of approvals.
3. **Multi-User Approval**:
- Collective Approval: When Aarav raises a request, it goes simultaneously to Priya, Rajesh, and
Sunita.
- Final Approval: Only after all three have approved, the request proceeds to Mohan, the final
approver in the configuration.
### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs):
1. **User and Company Creation**: Backend functionality to create and manage user profiles and
company details.
2. **Approval Creation API**:
- For creating approval requests, complete with header and line item details.
- This API handles the instantiation of the approval process.
3. **Approval Status API**:
- Enables users to view the current status of any approval request.
- Provides real-time tracking and updates.
4. **Approval Action API**:
- To approve or reject a request.
- Facilitates decision-making by authorized users.
5. **Comments Addition API**:
- For adding comments to an approval (both line and header).
- Enhances communication and clarity within the approval process.
6. **Workflow Design API**:
- Allows the creation and customization of workflows.
- Includes setting trigger points based on approval values, types, and user roles.
### Additional Considerations:
- **Security and Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized personnel can access and modify
approvals.
- **Notification System**: Implement alerts for each stage of the approval process.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain logs for tracking changes and actions taken on ea
